<p>In San Francisco, I was unable to get plugged into a shelter, so I decided to take to the streets. While getting to know some of the San Francisco homeless community, I met Dophie. Everything that I learned on this trip, he was able to eloquently summarize over a few conversations. Below I have included an excerpt from the first part of our conversation, as well as the full audio. I will put the second part of the conversation up soon.</p>
<p>Dophie is the patron saint of Humanity for the Homeless.</p>
<p>“All that a lot of us really ask for is a little human compassion and a little understanding. The majority of the people don’t want to sit out here and commit crime to get the things they need, whether it’s food… or whatever it might be. It’s what they feel by their surroundings that they’re left with. They haven’t been… and this is 100% true… they haven’t been taught any better, and they can’t learn from somebody they don’t respect. A lot of these people [homeless] don’t respect the majority of people, because the majority of people don’t respect them.”</p>
