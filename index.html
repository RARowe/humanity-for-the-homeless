		<h2>The Wisdom of Dophie</h2>
		<h4>April 21, 2016</h4>

		<p>In San Francisco, I was unable to get plugged into a shelter, so I decided to take to the streets. While getting to know some of the San Francisco homeless community, I met Dophie. Everything that I learned on this trip, he was able to eloquently summarize over a few conversations. Below I have included an excerpt from the first part of our conversation, as well as the full audio. I will put the second part of the conversation up soon.</p>
		<p>Dophie is the patron saint of Humanity for the Homeless.</p>
		<p>“All that a lot of us really ask for is a little human compassion and a little understanding. The majority of the people don’t want to sit out here and commit crime to get the things they need, whether it’s food… or whatever it might be. It’s what they feel by their surroundings that they’re left with. They haven’t been… and this is 100% true… they haven’t been taught any better, and they can’t learn from somebody they don’t respect. A lot of these people [homeless] don’t respect the majority of people, because the majority of people don’t respect them.”</p>

		<h2>The Point</h2>
		<h4>April 10, 2016</h4>
		<img src ="photos/IMG_2940.jpg" />
		<p>When I sat down to write this blog entry, the original intention was to talk about my positive experience in the Norman, Oklahoma shelter, the friends I had made there, and my take away from the week. While I still plan on writing that post in the future, something happened yesterday that has redirected my energy.</p>
		<p>The past few days have been a whirlwind. With the help of very little sleep and fast food, I made it from Norman, OK to San Francisco for the final leg of my trip. I am staying with one of my buddies from college, Eric Coatney, and will spend the week working in a shelter a few blocks from his apartment. Before starting at the shelter, like most places I’ve visited, I spent the first day touring the city. Eric and I ended up walking close to ten miles, exploring sites both well-known and hidden.</p>
		<p>Homelessness is rampant in San Francisco. One does not have to walk ten miles to realize this fact (see this link for some quick info). Every corner… every alley… every populated area… the homeless permeate the city. Even one the wealthiest regions on the planet cannot manage its homeless population.</p>
		<p>The catalyst for this trip involved a disturbing event that I witnessed in Houston (see trip catalyst). It only seems appropriate that after all that I have seen, I must be disturbed one last time.</p>
		<p>When touring the city yesterday, Eric and I arrived at the square populated by the Grace Cathedral and Fairmont hotel. A man starting walking toward us donning a torn, dirty pink t-shirt, short skirt, and ear plugs in both ears. He was talking to himself, staring at the ground, and seemingly limping on both legs. This image has unfortunately become common to me working in the shelters, so I briefly explained to Eric what we were seeing. Unfortunately, I am not personally equipped to handle a person having a schizophrenic flareup outside of the context of a shelter, so I figured it was best to let this man go on his way.</p>
		<p>This event did not disturb me, but what Eric pointed out to me did. About 100 feet away, two men were video taping the event and laughing. Here was a man at his literal wits end, and two people decided to take advantage of the situation to show all of their friends back home (they seemed to be tourists). The misfortune of one is comedy for another I suppose…</p>
		<p>I have been asked over and over again for my solution to the homelessness problem. Though I have some ideas, and have seen which techniques do and do not work, any answer that I give will not be sufficient. How do we reach such an answer? We must engage in productive discussion of homelessness, based on a solid understanding of the problem.</p>
		<p>I have identified three levels in which people discuss homelessness. The highest and most productive level comes after working with and becoming engaged in the homeless community. It is here that one can learn about the psychology of homelessness, the cultural norms in the community, and the circumstances that spiral people to a life on the streets. I encourage everybody to gain experience to reach this level of understanding. If everybody sat at this level, I truly believe homelessness would be gone in a matter of years.</p>
		<p>If we move down one rung on the ladder of discussion, we find a group of people that admit at the core of homelessness, there is mental illness, drug dependency, and alcoholism… and let me say, it is rampant. Like the gentleman I saw yesterday, it is not uncommon to meet people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illness in the shelters. Even more so, what would be classified as milder disorders, anti-social behavior, mild depression, and learning disabilities really show themselves in the shelter. Mix these mild disorders with a few bad life events, and one ends up on the street. This was my level of understanding at the beginning of this trip.</p>
		<p>The final, and most non-productive rung, is to dismiss the homeless as lazy/unmotivated. My ears have unfortunately been deafened by people with this view. Even if they do not believe in making a sweeping generalization of the community, I always get the, “yeah, but there are still those people that are just taking advantage of the system.” After the things that I have seen, if these people do exist, they are so few and far between that their burden on society is very minimal. Many times, I have seen this view as an excuse to do nothing at all.</p>
		<p>My goal, through my experiences, stories, and understanding of the problem is to lift discussion off of this bottom rung. That’s it. Once we no longer consider the lowest level as a possibility, nothing will be hindering us from having truly productive discussion about what is to be done.</p>
		<p>To better understand this, let me introduce an analogy. In recent history, we have seen a movement against the use of vaccinations. There is very little evidence supporting that vaccinations are harmful, and most of this evidence comes from questionable/second-hand sources. In the discussion of vaccinations, those who are actively trying to solve the problems of treatable diseases in children sit at the “highest rung” category. These people would include scientists, chemists, and doctors. The next level are those people that acknowledge vaccines are good, and should be used to reduce diseases in children. Though their understanding of the science may not be as in depth as the former, they allow progress in the field to happen. The final category, the lowest rung, are those people who actively campaign against vaccines. We could dismiss them, but these people still have sway in society. In many states, legislation has been put forward to not require vaccinations, which could lead to dire consequences at every rung on the ladder.</p>
		<p>Homelessness is a social issue, and can only be solved in a social manner. It is imperative for our communities to rally around the homeless, and devise solutions that come from a place of education, love, and sympathy. We must no longer view the homeless as objects of laughter, scoff, and fear. When we get to this point, we can discuss real solutions.</p>
		<p>My call to everyone: Kill the stigma, embrace the community, solve the problem!</p>

		<h4>March 27, 2016</h4>

		<p>The events in these posts took place from February 23 to February 26.</p>
		<p>This will be the final entry (for now) on my experiences in NYC.</p>
		<p>In my travels, I have had the opportunity to work with a plethora of different people. In Chicago, I mainly worked with homeless people who volunteered in the shelter. In Boston, I worked with groups volunteering from financial firms, local businesses, and other outlets (check out Boston College’s 4Boston). In NYC, I worked with people who were somewhere in between.</p>
		<p>One of the most unique things the Bowery did was its “Gateway” program. Gateway is a year-long course that helps at-risk men acquire some kind of trade, and get their lives back on track. The best way I heard it explained was by one of the men in the program, “Man, I’ve worked my whole life, but only about 20% of it was on the books. I’m trying to do something different.” Gateway begins at the Bowery, where the men in the program live, work, and have Bible classes for about 3-months. Once they have finished their time at the Bowery, they move to another property equipped with classrooms, computer labs, and shops to learn a skill, trade, and other constructive work.</p>
		<p>Though some of the men were a little rough around the edges, I found myself enjoying their company. I cannot speak for all of them, but the men took their work, and the work of helping the homeless, very seriously. Many had never actually been homeless, but had been close. They had seen what the “streets” can do to people, and how easy it is to end up back where they started. Because of these things, the men of Gateway helped the homeless with a disposition of true compassion, one that I can only hope to emulate in the future.</p>

		<h4>March 27, 2016</h4>
		<img src="photos/IMG_2755.jpg"/>
		<p>The events in these posts took place from February 23 to February 26.</p>
		<p>Many times when I volunteer, there is not a set of tasks for me when I arrive at the beginning of the day, so I have to seek out jobs from the people that work at the shelters. My second day at the Bowery was no different. Upon arrival, I was told to locate Pastor Jason (the lead pastor of the Bowery Mission), because there was thought that he had a few tasks to take care of.</p>
		<p>I found Pastor Jason, whom I talked to briefly the day before, on his way down from his office. Before he gave the me the task, he asked what I was capable of and willing to do. My standard reply was always, “anything and everything.” Jason liked this, and then proceeded to tell me that I was to scrape the gum off of the chapel floor, sweep it up, mop the floor, return the pews to their original orientation, and, once I had finished this, clean the stairs going up to the balcony (that were at one time red, but had turned a shade of gray due to all the treading), and finally, clean the balcony itself. He said the work wasn’t going to be glamorous, but there were going to be some esteemed guests visiting the Bowery, and the place needed to be cleaned up.</p>
		<p>My curiosity was killing me, so I probed as to who would be visiting the Bowery. Robert De Niro. Not only was he visiting, a movie was to be filmed there. This led to a flood of questions:</p>
		<p>What’s the premise of the movie? De Niro gets in trouble and has to do community service. (Short Version)</p>
		<p>Where will they be shooting? The chapel, my (Pastor Jason’s) office, and the balcony.</p>
		<p>Are you going to be in the movie, Pastor Jason? Yes.</p>
		<p>The last question made me start thinking. I asked if he was going to be in the movie, was his name going to appear in the credits? The answer was yes. I told him that I would be happy to scrape the gum off of the floors, but he had to see what strings he could pull to get “Andrew Rowe- Chapel Gum Scraper” added to the credits.</p>

		<h4>March 27, 2016</h4>
		<img src="photos/IMG_2764.jpg" />
		<p>The events in these posts took place from February 23 to February 26.</p>
		<p>My first day at the Bowery, I ate lunch by myself. The shelter clients were in the daily, pre-lunch chapel, and a group of volunteers from a local business were busy eating and chatting about work-related antics a few tables away from me. In walks Pauline. She noticed me and asked jokingly if I had been banned from the group. I laughed and briefly explained what I was doing, and that I was not with them. She asked if she could join me, which I encouraged.</p>
		<p>We started with light conversation. When she talked, her accent heavily blanketed her words. Definitely not typical for NYC. I pointed it out, and she explained that she was from Bryant, Arkansas. Ah! One of my people! We reminisced on warmer weather, mutually visited locations, and eventually got onto the topic of how she ended up in NYC. In her past life, Pauline had been a nurse in the Little Rock area, and had made yearly mission trips to the Bowery as a girl. She ended up getting so involved in what she called “the community” associated with the Bowery, she felt like she had to stay. She now works full-time in the kitchen.</p>
		<p>Imagine that… abandoning all that is familiar! Moving from small town Arkansas, to an apartment in the big city for the soul purpose of full-time volunteer work. Pauline left behind family, friends, and other things she once held dear, but she was excited about the prospect. Why?</p>
		<p>In her words, “The men that come here are just like big kids. They need a little love and a mom.”</p>
		<h2>This Trip in a Nutshell</h2>
		<h4>March 25, 2016</h4>

		<p>While working at the Norcross Cooperative Ministry in Norcross, GA, I saw this posted on the break room wall. It summarizes some of my reasons for doing this trip really well, and touches on some of the things I talk about on my “About” page. As Christians, it is up to us to be the answer to prayer.</p>
		<p>Christ has no body now on earth but mine. No hands but mine, no feet but mine, mine are the eyes through which Christ’s compassion is to look out to the earth, mine are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and mine are the hands by which He will use to bless us now. -St. Teresa of Avila</p>
